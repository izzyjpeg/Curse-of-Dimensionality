Curse of Dimensionality: A Virtual Pet Game for Sad Ganbreeders

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

A virtual pet game based on imagery from GANs (Generative Adversarial [Neural] Networks),
and Joel Simon's GAN creation interface, GANbreeder. A pet's features are determined by
adjusting sliders, which generate a point in 13-dimensional feature space that matches
the user's preferences to the features of one of 50 GAN images.

Users can play an asteroids-inspired mini-game to earn food.
Food can be given to the pet to enhance or subtract from the pet's features.

Want to learn more about the process? Create a pet and select "About Game" from the map.

How to run: Install Pygame. Open main.py and execute the script.
Don't change the file structure! I'm a beginner and things will get messed up.
