Curse of Dimensionality: A Virtual Pet Game for Sad Ganbreeders

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Description: A virtual pet game based on imagery from GANs (Generative Adversarial [Neural] Networks) and Joel Simon's GAN creation interface, GANbreeder. A pet's features are determined by adjusting sliders, which generate a point in 13-dimensional feature space that matches the user's preferences to the features of one of 50 GAN images.
Users can play an asteroids-inspired mini-game to earn food. Food can be given to the pet to enhance or subtract from the pet's features.

How to run: Install Pygame. Open main.py and run. Do not change the file structure.
